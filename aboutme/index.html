      Ive just transferred ny degree from a CIT major to a Software Dev Major as
      the catalog number for CIT expires next year and will not give me
      sufficient time to complete, mores the pity. I'm looking forward to
      working with everyone.

      hope that it doen;t get too hectic. I quite enjoy programming and Web

      knowledge of Python and Web Dev this semester.
